# Run: npx tsc

- This compiles your typescript file into readable JavaScript for your browser

## Notes:

### TYPES: Simple and Special Types

**3 Simple types** or primitives in JS and TS:

1. **Boolean:** t/f
2. **Number:** whole numbers and floating point values
3. **String:** text values like "Typescript"

**5 Special Types** that may not refer to any specific type of data

1. **any:** disables typechecking and allows all types to be used
2. **unknown:** safer option to any, best used when we don't know the type of the variable
3. **never:** rarely used as it simply throws an error when it's defined
4. **undefined:** same as JS variable with an undefined value
5. **null:** Same as HS var with a null value
